# ðŸŒ± **Carbon Footprint Calculator**

## **About the Project**
The **Carbon Footprint Calculator** is an interactive web application built using **Streamlit**. It allows users to estimate their carbon emissions based on their daily activities. By simply describing their activities (e.g., "I drove my car for 50 km and used electricity for 100 kWh"), users can:
- Parse their inputs into meaningful activities and quantities.
- Calculate carbon emissions using predefined emission factors.
- Visualize the emissions by activity.
- Download the emission report as a CSV file.

This project empowers individuals to understand their carbon footprint and take steps toward a more sustainable future.

## **Features**
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Automatically recognizes activities and quantities from user inputs.
- **Activity Categories**: Includes emissions from transportation, energy usage, cooking, waste management, and more.
- **Emission Calculations**: Uses predefined emission factors to calculate carbon emissions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays a bar chart showing emissions by activity.
- **Exportable Reports**: Users can download their emission results as a CSV file.

## **Dataset**
The project utilizes the dataset **`Updated_CO2_Emission_Factors.xlsx`** to calculate emissions. This dataset contains:
- **Activity descriptions**.
- **Corresponding COâ‚‚ emission factors** (in kg COâ‚‚/unit).

### **Dataset Preview**:
| **Activity**            | **COâ‚‚ Emission Factor (kg COâ‚‚/unit)** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Air travel (short haul)  | 0.254                                 |
| Electricity usage (kWh)  | 0.233                                 |
| Driving (km)             | 0.12                                  |
| Water usage (liters)     | 0.001                                 |
| Plastic waste (kg)       | 6.0                                   |

The emission factors were compiled from reputable sources to provide accurate and reliable calculations.
